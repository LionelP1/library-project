# Library Project ðŸ“š

## Project Description
The Library Project is a web application that allows users to add, view, and manage books in a virtual library. Users can input book details such as title, author, pages, and read status. The system features a dynamic book grid and a modal form for adding new books. Books can be marked as "read" or "not read," and can be removed from the library with ease.
